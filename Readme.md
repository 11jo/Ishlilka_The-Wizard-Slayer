Ishlilka the Wizard Slayer a NPC for BGSoD :

Baldur's Gate: EE+ SoD and the Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET).


## Description:
--------------

Ishlilka is a Wizard Slayer who can be found at the Friendly Arm Inn just north of the entrance.  

She is good aligned and gets on best with good aligned characters such as 
Garrick, Imoen, and Alora. She has *no party conflicts* but will express her displeasure with evil characters.  

She is romancable by males who are Half Orcs, Humans, or Half Elves. 
Particularly cruel acts or words may end the romance abruptly.  

## Infos

- Ishlilka should be compatible with most major BG mods (NPC Project, other NPC mods, etc.).

- Ishlilka's quest in BG1 will start a short time after Chapter 2 and SOD's quest will happen before entering Dragonspear's underground.

- Ishlilka will leave your party upon entering SOD. You will get her back as soon as Korlasz Tomb is over and you exit the Ducal Palace. She may linger for a few seconds before vanishing.
